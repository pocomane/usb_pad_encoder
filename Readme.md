# USB game-pad encoder with Arduino

This is a Arduino sketch to read a various pad protocols and convert them to
USB HID events. It is focused on pads of old consoles like the SNES.

# Select the protocol

By default the sketch is configured to read the SNES protocol. To change it,
just set the `INPUT_PROTOCOL` macro at beginning of the sketch to one of the
following supported protocols:

- `SNES` - To read NES or SNES pads
- `FULLSWITCH` - To read the controllers made fully of switches, like Atari 2600,
  Commodore, Amiga and JAMMA.
- `ATARI_PADDLE` - To read dual paddle controller for Atari 2600. This is in
  development, it is NOT TESTED YET !

# Auto-fire

The sketch has an auto-fire assist feature enabled. With a small change you can
turn it off or use a more classic auto-fire mode. The two modes supported are
the following.

In the ASSIST mode to start an autofire sequence you have to tap three time one
of the A/B/X/Y button and then hold it down. The auto-fire will continue until
you release the button.

In the TOGGLE mode, if you press and release SELECT while one of the A/B/X/Y
button is down it will enable and disable the auto-fire for that button.

# Compile and flash

It should be easy to compile and flash the sketch using the Arduino IDE or
`arduino-cli`, however the `build.sh` script is provided. It uses `arduino-cli`
(that must be installed in the system) to install the dependencies, to compile
the code, and to upload it to an arduino board. The script should make simple
also to modify some setting, like the name with which the Arduino board will
present itself.

Note: if you want use the Arduino IDE to compile the code, some version may
need the joystick library: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary .

# Build an adaptor

TODO : write instructions !

# Configure auto-fire mode

The sketch can be configured to enable two kind of auto-fire. You have just to
set the `AUTOFIRE_MODE` macro at the beginning of the file to `NONE`, `ASSIST`
or `TOGGLE`.

In the `NONE` mode, no auto-fire is generated, like the original SNES pad.

For all the other modes you can use the `AUTOFIRE_PERIOD` macro to change the
time between two taps generated by the auto-fire system.

If you selected the `ASSIST` mode, you can use the `TAP_MAX_PERIOD` macros to
set the maximum time between real taps to accept. Moreover, changing the
`AUTOFIRE_TAP_COUNT` macro you can set the number of consecutive taps to wait
before start the auto-fire sequence.

If you selected the `TOGGLE` mode, you can use the `AUTOFIRE_SELECTOR` to chage
the button to use as toggle in the `TOGGLE` mode (the default is `select`). Note
that some pad with few buttons (like the Atari one) can not use this mode.

# Configure simulation mode

If you define the `SIMULATION_MODE` at beginning of the source, a simulation
mode will be enabled. In such mode the board will not register itself as a HID
device neither it will send any HID events. However it will enable logging and
debug message over serial port, so you can inspect its operation with serial
console client like `minicom`. This mode is useful in development.

# Configure Arduino USB name

To change the name that arduino uses to identify itself on USB, you have to
change the `avr/boards.txt` file in the IDE setup folder. E.g., if you have an
Arduino Micro board:

```
...

## original ardunio USB VID/PID/Name
#micro.build.vid=0x2341
#micro.build.pid=0x8037
#micro.build.usb_product="Arduino Micro"

# Open source project USB VID - https://pid.codes/1209
# (test USB PID from 0x0000 to 0x010)
micro.build.vid=0x1209
micro.build.pid=0x0001
#micro.build.usb_product="Player 1 Input (arduino)"
micro.build.usb_product="SNES USB pad (arduino)"

...
```

This for example is usefull if you want to connect different kind of
arduino-powered to the same computer and have it to remember setups for each of
them.
